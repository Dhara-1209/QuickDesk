# QuickDesk

QuickDesk is a simple and efficient **Help Desk System** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It enables users to raise support tickets and track their status, while support agents can manage and resolve them.
The admin oversees users, categories, and ticket workflows.

This system streamlines communication between users and support teams, ensuring faster issue resolution and better transparency.
